Here is my [CV]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/resume.pdf).

👋 Hi there — welcome to my personal homepage!

🎓 I am a 3rd-year master’s student at the South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, currently completing my master’s research, which I expect to finish by summer 2026.

📚 After earning my master’s degree, I am aiming to pursue a PhD in Oceanography, focusing on ocean modelling or relevant topics.

----
My research Interest includes:
- Physical Oceanography
- Tropical Cyclone Dynamics
- Air-sea Interaction
- Ocean Modeling
- High-Performance Computing (at a beginner/intermediate level)

----

I have experience in **typhoon simulation using air-sea coupled model**, and I am eager to further develop my skills in numerical modeling and computational methods applied to oceanographic processes.
